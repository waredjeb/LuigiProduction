## Trigger Scale Factor Studies
--------------------

Framework which calculate 1D and 2D trigger scale factors, starting from sikimmed Ntuples. It is defined using the ```luigi``` package in ```run_workflow.py```. The framework also allows displaying Data/MC comparison of single variable distributions.
Two steps are reuqired for obtaining the results:

- all tasks up to the HTCondor jobs submission: binning calculation and histogram filling
- all tasks after the submission: efficiency calculations and plotting

Requirements:

- ```python 3.9``` (likely works on other Python 3 versions)
- ```luigi``` (available in ```CMSSW``` after running ```cmsenv``` and using ```python3```).


#### Luigi Workflow

To run the submission workflow, please type the following:

```shell
python3 run_workflow.py --outuser <lxplus username> --scheduler local --tag <any tag> --data MET2018 --mc_process TT --triggers nonStandard HT500 METNoMu120 METNoMu120_HT60 MediumMET100 MediumMET110 MediumMET130 --submit
```

To run the remaining part of the (local) workflow, run the same command without the ```--submit``` flag.

| Output files              | Destination folder                                  |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ```ROOT```                | ```/data_CMS/cms/alves/TriggerScaleFactors/v1/```    |
| Submission                | ```$HOME/jobs/v1/<process>/submission/```           |
| Condor (output and error) | ```$HOME/jobs/v1/<process>/outputs/```              |
| Pictures (requires ```/eos/```) | ```/eos/home-b/bfontana/www/TriggerScaleFactors/``` |


Check the meaning of the arguments by adding ```--help```.
You can also run each ```luigi``` task separately by running its corresponding ```python``` scripts (all support ```--help```)

#### Cleanup

In order to avoid cluttering the local area with output files, a ```bash``` script was written to effortlessly delete them:

```
bash triggerClean.sh --tag <any tag>
```

where:

- ```-d```: debug mode, where all commands are printed to the screen and nothing is run
- ```-f```: full delete, including data produced by the HTCondor jobs (this flag is required to avoid data deletions by mistake)
- ```--tag```: tag used when producing the files (remove this options to print a message displaying all tags used in the past which were not yet removed)

-------------------------------------

#### Notes on ```luigi```

The advantages of using a workflow management system as ```luigi``` are the following:

- the whole chain can be run at once
- the workflow is clearer from a code point of view
- the configuration is accessible from within a single file (```luigi.cfg```)
- a task in the chain is run only if at least one output file of a task on which it depends is more recent that at least one of the output files it already produced (via the ```ForceableEnsureRecentTarget``` custom class in ```luigi_utils.py```)
- when two tasks do not share dependencies they can run in parallel

A standard ```luigi.Task``` is run when its outputs do not yet exist. By subclassing it and overwrite its ```complete()``` method, one can control this behaviour. This is done in ```luigi_utils.py```.

If one chooses ```--scheduler central```, one has to run ```luigid &``` first, and can control the number of workers to be used via ```--workers <number_of_workers>```. 

To force tasks to run, even if their output files already exist, use ```--force VALUE```, where ```VALUE``` ranges form 0 to the total number of tasks in the worflow. For instance, when ```VALUE=3```, the framework will force the three higher-level tasks to run: testing, training and energy normalization. The default, ```VALUE=0```, implies no forceful run. Finally, by choosing ```--user```, one can decide where the output data will be saved.

The parameter ```--tag``` must be used. It will create a folder where all the outputs will be stored.

The default configuration of the worflow is defined in the ```luigi_cfg.py``` class and can be overridden in the ```luigi.cfg``` TOML file, as explained in [```luigi```'s docs](https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html).

The explicit definition of each task's outputs is an essential feature of ```luigi```. To make the process more transparent, this worflow stores file names under a configurable folder (```targets``` parameter in ```Config(luigi.Config())```) which includes all outputs of all tasks. Again, a task is run only if at least one of its outputs is older than its requirements (see ```luigi_utils.py```), or if ```--force``` is used.

> **_COMMON ERROR:_** When further extending the worflow by adding more tasks or changing some of their targets, it is quite common to observe an error indicating ```RuntimeError: Unfulfilled dependency at run time: <task>```. This shows that the task did not produce all the targets as expected by its ```output()``` method, causing its ```complete()``` method to always fail. The first it does, the worflow assumes the task to be lacking some dependencies, and so it reruns it. By construction, as soon as ```complete()``` fails again the error has to be thrown. Search for a mismatch on the names of the files produced and those expected by ```output()```, which could be subtle, such as an extra ```\n```. 

- **Debugging**: by passing ```--debug_workflow```, the user can obtain more information regarding the specific order tasks and their functions are run.

- **Visualizing the workflow**: when using ```--scheduler central```, one can visualize the ```luigi``` workflow by accessing the correct port in the browser, specified with ```luigid --port <port_number> &```. If using ```ssh```, the port will have to be forwarded to the local machine by using, for instance:

```shell
ssh -L <port_number>:localhost:<port_number> <server_address>
```

You should then be able to visualize the worflow in your browser by going to ```localhost:<port_number>```.

#### Future steps: using ```law```

In case [```law```](https://github.com/riga/law) is required (to manage ```htcondor``` jobs), one can install it as follows, using ```conda```:


- Install a [miniconda release](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (python 3.7 linux used here)
- Convert ```law``` to a conda package using ```conda-build``` (this will not be required as soon as ```law``` is made available in some ```conda``` channel):

```
#from the conda "base" environment
conda install conda-build
conda skeleton pypi law
conda-build law
```

- Create conda environment and install the [```law```](https://github.com/riga/law) and [```ROOT```](https://root.cern/install/#conda) packages:

```
conda create --name <name> python=3.9
conda activate <name>
conda install --use-local law #install the conda package created in the previous step

#install ROOT from the ```conda-forge``` channel
conda config --set channel_priority strict 
conda install -c conda-forge root
```
